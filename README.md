Free Code Camp Projects Repository
Welcome to my Free Code Camp Projects Repository! This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of projects I've completed as part of the Free Code Camp curriculum. These projects span various domains and technologies, including:

Web Development: From front-end to back-end development, showcasing my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, and more.

Machine Learning: Projects involving data analysis, predictive modeling, and other machine learning techniques using Python, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and other relevant libraries.

Databases: Database management and integration projects, featuring SQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and other database technologies.

Just a heads up that I may not be able to finish all the courses because I do not just rely into one source but whenever I finished a project from FreeCodeCamp, it goes here :).
